# Utilities and Practice

My own little repository for stashing utility objects I've created, algorithms I've implemented, or for completing questions from sites like leetcode. Nearly all of these are intended to be used as learning experiences, and probably won't be making their way into any of my other libraries (unless their code teaches me something I can use there, of course). 

Folder division is like so:

- Objects will be structures and classes that perform various tasks: usually do what they say on the tin
- Algorithms will be for implementing various sorting, mathematical, and hashing algorithms
- Problems will be specifically code used to completing challenge or interview questions. Generally, I try to link the problem being answered in the file.

Unlicensed, so do whatever you like with it. Mostly put this up so I could track progress and easily share code with friends for code reviews and guidance.
